# SingleFileRobotSimulations
Simulations of robotic single-file motion replicating traffic jam dynamics with obstacle detectors. Explore stop-and-go waves, fundamental speed-density relations, and observe transitions among free flow, intermittent flow, and total congestion. Enables comprehensive statistical analysis of global dynamics.
